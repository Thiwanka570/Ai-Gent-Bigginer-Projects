# 🩺 AI-Powered Medical Assistant & Doctor Appointment System

This project is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that brings together AI-powered symptom collection, specialty recommendation, and doctor appointment scheduling — all in a single, streamlined system.

## 🚀 Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Agents (Gemini API)
- **Symptom Collector Agent**  
  Engages in a real-time conversation with patients to gather symptoms and stores the data securely in MongoDB.
  
- **Recommendation Agent**  
  Analyzes the collected symptom data and recommends the correct **doctor specialty** based on clinical reasoning.

### 📋 Doctor Management
- Fetches doctors by specialty from the MongoDB database.
- Allows patients to view a list of doctors related to the AI's recommendation.

### 🔐 Authentication
- JWT-based secure login and registration system for patients.

### 📨 Messaging & Notifications
- Integrates **Apache Kafka** for handling real-time message queues between microservices (AI agents and backend).
